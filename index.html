                <p>
                    Python is an all purpose, high level and interpreted language.  It was created in the late 1980's by Guido van Rossum as followup to the ABC programming language.
                    Guido Van Rossum's goal was to create a programming language that emphasized code readability.  Version 1.0 was released in 1991.  Nine years later in 2000 version
                    2.0 was released.  In 2008 version 3.0 was released.  In 2020 version 2.0 was officially retired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python is currently on version 3.9.0.       
                </p>

            <header>Printing to the Screen</header>
            <p>
                To do display text on the screen:<br>
                <div class='sample-code'>
                    <code>print(what you want to print)</code><br>
                </div>
                An example of this is:<br>
                <div class='sample-code'>
                    <code>print("Hello World")</code><br>
                </div>
                <div class='sample-output'>
                    <samp>Hello World</samp><br>
                </div>
                <code>print()</code> is a method which is explained further in this document.  Some methods can be passed paramaters.  The example
                above shows that <code>"Hello World"</code> is the parameter being passed to <code>print()</code> another parameter you can pass to
                <code>print()</code> is a variable which is described in more detail in the next section.<br>
                <div class='sample-code'>
                    <code>
                        variable = "Hello World"<br>
                        print(variable)
                    </code><br>
                </div>
                <div class='sample-output'>
                    <samp>Hello World</samp>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>Use the .format() method to insert variables inside your <code>print()</code> statement.</p>
            <div class='sample-code'>
                <code>print('{0} and {1}'.format('Python', 'Documentation'))</code>
            </div>
            <div class='sample-output'>
                <samp>Python and Documentation</samp>

            <header>Variables</header>
                <p>Python uses three main data types for storing variables. String, Numeric, and Boolean.</p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Strings</h4>
                    <p>A string is text that is surrounded by quotes. <code>string_example = "This is a string!"</code></p>
                    <p>
                        Strings store whatever you put inside the quotes except for when you use quotes inside the quotes 
                        you have to be careful on which quote you use to define the string and which quote is a part of the string.
                        <code>bad_string = "I am the "worst""</code> this will result in an error or the variable not being stored correctly.
                        <code>good_string = 'I am the "best"?'</code> which will work with no problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can convert any non-string into a string by using <code>str()</code><br>
                        <div class='sample-code'>
                            <code>not_string = 6 #No quotes around the 6 means Python stores it as a number not a string</code><br>
                            <code>print(str(not_string))</code><br>
                        </div>
                        <div class='sample-output'>
                            <samp>6</samp>
                        </div>
                        This is nessecary when concatenating diffrent data types.
                    </p>
                    <p>Select different characters in a string by using <code>[]</code> notation. Keep in mind like most programming languages
                        Python starts counting from zero which would be the first character in a string.
                        <div class='sample-code'>
                            <code>my_string = "Howdy"</code><br>
                            <code>print(my_string[4])</code><br>
                        </div>
                        <div class='sample-output'>
                            <samp>t</samp>
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>len()</code> will return the length of your string.  The count begins at 1 instead of zero like the <code>[]</code> notation.
                        <div class='sample-code'>
                            <code>my_string = 'Count the length'</code><br>
                            <code>print(len(my_string))</code><br>
                        </div>
                        <div class='sample-output'>
                            <samp>16</samp>
                        </div>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Numbers</h4>
                    <p>A number is any value that you use to do calculations.  <code>my_number = 17</code> Once you</p>
                    <div class='sample-code'>
                        <code></code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li></li>

        <section class='main-section' id='Getting_Input_from_Users'>
            <header>Getting Input from Users</header>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of a program is getting input.  Users are the primary source of input
                but it can come from files or the computer itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will cover the other sources of input later on but for now we will focus on getting input from the user.
            </p>
            <p>To get user input all we have to do is create a variable for that input to go into and then use Input(prompt)</p>
            <code>user_data = input("Please input some data: ")</code>
            <p>This will display</p>
            <p>The program will wait for a response from the user and then assign it to the variable</p>
            <p>So in the previous example user_data was the variable and let's say we used the number 42 as the input.  We then 
                can use the print statement to display what the user inputted.
            </p>
            <code>user_data = input("Please input some data: ")</code><br>
            <code>print(user_display)</code><br>
            <code>42</code>


        </section>
        <section class='main-section' id='List'>
            <header>List</header>
                <p>List are ways to store many points of data into one variable for later retrieval</p>
                <p>Let's take the following example which will only use variables</p>
                <code>myName = "Jimmy"</code><br>
                <code>myAge = 31</code><br>
                <code>is_married = False</code>
                <p>Then any time we had to access the varibles and get information we would have to name all 3</p>
                <code>print(myName + " " + myAge + " " + is_married)</code>
                <p>Which quickly becomes tedious.  A list is easier to create and access when needed.</p>
                <code>user_info = ["Jimmy",31, False]</code>
                <p>The information is now store in one variable.  Notice the square brackets these tell Python the information inside is a List
                    make sure to seperate out each item with a comma.
                </p>
            
        </section>
        <section class='main-section' id='Tuples'>
            <header>Tuples</header>
                
                <p>A way to store mutiple pieces of data in one variable that cannot be changed after
                    the creation of the tuple.
                </p>
                <code>myTuple = (42, "Hello, World", True)</code>
                <p>The above tuple now has 3 diffirent pieces of data store in it.  The parenthesis around the items tells
                    Python that it is a tuple.
                </p>
                <p>You can then later access the data by accessing the variable and then which item you want that it is storing.  Keep in mind 
                    Python like most programming languages begin counting at 0.
                </p>
                <code>print(myTuple(0))</code><br>
                <p>Will display</p>
                <code>42</code>
            
        </section>
        <section class='main-section'  id='Conditionals'>
            <header>Conditionals</header>
            <p>Python uses if and else as conditionals.</p>
            <p>When using conditional make sure to use an operator(==) not an assignment(=)</p>
            <code>myVar = 'Hello'</code><br>
            <code>if(myVar == 'Hello'):</code><br>  
            <code>    print(myVar)</code><br>
